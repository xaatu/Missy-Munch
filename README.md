Sorry this folder and code is a mess

This was the first game I made using Pygame, I started off using a basic flappy bird-esque Youtube video guide and then implemented some of my own tweaks to make it "Missy Munch" an ode to my lovely cat Missy.

Pixel art made on Piskel and music written in Reason (i've got a feeling i've ripped off a Pokemon song here, but can't put my finger on which one.)
